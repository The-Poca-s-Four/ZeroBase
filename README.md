# Project Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project.

---

## 1. Check Node.js and npm Versions

Before starting, make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

Run the following commands to check their versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If either of them is **not installed**, download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from the official website:

👉 [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

---

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

After installation, move into your project folder:

```bash
cd my-app
```

---

## 3. Start the Project

Use **Expo** to start the development server:

```bash
npx expo start
```

This command will launch Expo and give you options to run the app on a simulator, physical device, or web browser.

---

## 4. Optional: Install Dependencies (if needed)

If you haven’t already installed dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

✅ You’re all set! Your project should now be running successfully.
